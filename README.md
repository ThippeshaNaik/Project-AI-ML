The main steps need to follow for this task:

To execute the project described above, which involves leveraging a 20-year dataset stored on Amazon S3 for AI/ML capabilities using Apache Spark, deploying on Amazon EKS with a CI/CD pipeline, model version management, and other considerations, you would follow these steps:

Define Requirements and Architecture: Clearly define the requirements of your AI/ML project, including data sources, desired analytics outcomes, and infrastructure needs. Design the architecture, considering components such as Apache Spark for ETL, Amazon S3 for data storage, Amazon EKS for container orchestration, CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments, GPU nodes for computational power, etc.

Set Up AWS Account: If you don't have one already, sign up for an AWS account and ensure you have the necessary permissions to create resources like Amazon EKS clusters, S3 buckets, etc.

Provision Amazon EKS Clusters: Using Terraform, define infrastructure as code (IaC) templates to provision Amazon EKS clusters for development, testing, and production environments. Ensure each cluster is appropriately configured with the desired compute resources and networking settings.

Configure CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, or GitLab CI/CD. Configure the pipeline stages to build, test, and deploy your AI/ML application onto the Amazon EKS clusters. Integrate version control systems like GitHub or GitLab for source code management.

Implement Model Version Management: Choose a version control system like Git for managing your ML model versions. Establish a clear versioning strategy to track changes, experiment with different models, and deploy multiple versions as needed.

Deploy Microservices with Helm Charts: Develop Helm charts for essential microservices required for your AI/ML application, such as Apache Spark for ETL transformations. Use Terraform to automate the deployment process, ensuring consistency and repeatability across environments. Deploy these microservices into the designated 'Data-Pg' namespace within the Amazon EKS clusters.

Ensure Security Measures: Implement robust security measures following AWS best practices. This includes configuring Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) settings, network access controls, encryption for data at rest and in transit, and IAM roles and policies for fine-grained access control.

Backup Production Databases: Set up automated backups for production databases, such as MongoDB, using AWS Backup or custom scripts. Define backup schedules, retention policies, and recovery procedures to ensure data integrity and availability.

Optimize for GPU Nodes: Configure specialized GPU nodes within the Amazon EKS clusters for enhanced computational power, especially for resource-intensive AI/ML workloads. Optimize container configurations and resource allocation to leverage GPU acceleration effectively.

Test and Iterate: Thoroughly test the deployed solution across development, testing, and production environments. Monitor performance metrics, troubleshoot any issues, and iterate on the solution as needed to improve efficiency and reliability.
